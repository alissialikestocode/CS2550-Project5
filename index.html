--REFLECTION--
I hated this. So much. It felt like the difficulty level was too high for the kind of validation
labs we did, and it was exacerbated by how all over the place the instructions were. Why are there
two different replits linked in different parts of the instructions? I don't know. Stuff like that
makes it so easy to miss things. This was NOT ENJOYABLE and makes me dread having to take Web Dev 2.

                <h2>Where to Start with K-Dramas: My Top 5 Recommendations</h2>
                <p>
                    Next to BTS (--only 3 more months until they're all home!), one of the Korean cultural exports
                    everyone's talking
                    about these days is korean dramas, also known as k-dramas. For those of us who don't have the money
                    to drop on roundtrip
                    airfare to Korea, k-dramas are a great way to hear and study the language, learn a little bit about
                    the culture (I say a tiny bit because
                    k-dramas are about as real as the tv shows you watch in your own country), and see a
                    <strong>lot</strong> of delicious-looking food.
                </p>
                <p>
                    K-dramas have a lot of genres and something for everybody, but that's exactly why it can be tricky
                    to know what to start watching.
                    Below, I've ranked some of the k-dramas that I've enjoyed and think would be a great introduction to
                    the experience.
                    I tend to like more fantasy, slice-of-life, and historical dramas, so that's what you'll mostly see
                    here. If you like them, then
                    you'll have a good idea of what to start looking for next.

            <h4>Where to Watch</h4>
            <p>
                Netflix, Viki-Rakuten, and Youtube are all great sources for k-dramas. Pretty much all the ones I watch
                are from one of those three sources.
